abstract = {Optimization of drug delivery from drug loaded contact lenses assumes understanding the drug transport mechanisms through hydrogels which relies on the knowledge of drug partition and diffusion coefficients. We chose, as model systems, two materials used in contact lens, a poly-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (pHEMA) based hydrogel and a silicone based hydrogel, and three drugs with different sizes and charges: chlorhexidine, levofloxacin and diclofenac. Equilibrium partition coefficients were determined at different ionic strength and pH, using water (pH 5.6) and PBS (pH 7.4). The measured partition coefficients were related with the polymer volume fraction in the hydrogel, through the introduction of an enhancement factor following the approach developed by the group of C. J. Radke (Kotsmar et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013). This factor may be decomposed in the product of three other factors E HS , E el and E ad which account for, respectively, hard-sphere size exclusion, electrostatic interactions, and specific solute adsorption. While E HS and E el are close to 1, E ad {\textgreater} {\textgreater} 1 in all cases suggesting strong specific interactions between the drugs and the hydrogels. Adsorption was maximal for chlorhexidine on the silicone based hydrogel, in water, due to strong hydrogen bonding. The effective diffusion coefficients, D e , were determined from the drug release profiles. Estimations of diffusion coefficients of the non-adsorbed solutes D = D e × E ad allowed comparison with theories for solute diffusion in the absence of specific interaction with the polymeric membrane.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comparative study between the data collected in a drug dissolution experiment and the predictions obtained from simple mathematical approaches of drug diffusion in the delivery device and also with the results achieved from available kinetic models for dissolution processes. The controlled release of timolol maleate from a hydrogel disc, obtained by thermal copolymerization of hydroxyethyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid, was used as the case study.The equilibrium parameter (drug partition coefficient) used to model the mass transfer process dictates the predictions' accuracy. When this parameter is calculated from the drug release experiment, the diffusion equation with a Robin boundary condition type gives good predictions of the dissolution process. Predictions obtained with zero-sink condition in the release medium resulted in an overestimation of data.Several kinetic models available in the literature to describe drug release were used to correlate data. All the models tested describe the data adequately, but the Weibull model was the one that had the best correlation performance.},

abstract = {We measure and, for the first time, theoretically predict four prototypical aqueous-drug diffusion coefficients in five soft-contact-lens material hydrogels where solute-specific adsorption is pronounced. Two-photon fluorescence confocal microscopy and UV/Vis-absorption spectrophotometry assess transient solute concentration profiles and concentration histories, respectively. Diffusion coefficients are obtained for acetazolamide, riboflavin, sodium fluorescein, and theophylline in 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate/methacrylic acid (HEMA/MAA) copolymer hydrogels as functions of composition, equilibrium water content (30–90{\%}), and aqueous pH (2 and 7.4). At pH 2, MAA chains are nonionic, whereas at pH 7.4, MAA chains are anionic (pKa ≈ 5.2). All studied prototypical drugs specifically interact with HEMA and nonionic MAA (at pH 2) moieties. Conversely, none of the prototypical drugs adsorb specifically to anionic MAA (at pH 7.4) chains. As expected, diffusivities of adsorbing solutes are significantly diminished by specific interactions with hydrogel strands. Despite similar solute size, relative diffusion coefficients in the hydrogels span several orders of magnitude because of varying degrees of solute interactions with hydrogel-polymer chains. To provide a theoretical framework for the new diffusion data, we apply an effective-medium model extended for solute-specific interactions with hydrogel copolymer strands. Sorptive-diffusion kinetics is successfully described by local equilibrium and Henry's law. All necessary parameters are determined independently. Predicted diffusivities are in good agreement with experiment.},

abstract = {Transient solute absorption and desorption concentration profiles were measured in a 70 wt {\%} hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA)/30 wt {\%} methacrylic acid (MAA) anionic hydrogel using two-photon confocal microscopy. Dilute aqueous solutes included fluorescently labeled dextrans with molecular masses of 4, 10, and 20 kDa, and fluorescently labeled cationic avidin protein. Cross-linking densities with ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) varied from 0 to 1 wt {\%} with polymer volume fractions increasing from 0.15 to 0.25. Average gel mesh sizes, determined from zero-frequency oscillatory shear storage moduli, ranged from about 3.6 to 8.4 nm over the cross-link ratios studied. All solutes exhibit Stokes-Einstein hydrodynamic radii obtained from measured free diffusion coefficients, Do, comparable to or larger than the average gel mesh size. In spite of considerable size exclusion, the studied solutes penetrate the gels indicating a range of mesh sizes available for transport. Transient uptake and release concentration profiles for FITC-dextrans follow simple diffusion theory with diffusion coefficients, D, essentially independent of loading or release characteristic of reversible absorption. Although strongly size-excluded, these solutes do not interact specifically with the polymer network. Diffusivities are accordingly predicted from a large-pore effective-medium (LPEM) model developed to account for solute size, hydrodynamic drag, and distribution of mesh sizes available for transport in the polymer network. For this class of solute, and using no adjustable parameters, diffusivities predicted from the new effective-medium model demonstrate good agreement with experiment. For the specific-interacting cationic protein, avidin, gel loading is 3 orders of magnitude slower than that of dextran of similar hydrodynamic radius. Desorption of avidin is not complete even after 2 weeks of extraction. On the basis of size alone, avidin is strongly size-excluded, yet it exhibits a partition coefficient of over 20. For the positively charged protein, we observed specific ion binding on the negatively charged carboxylate groups of MAA-decorated polymer strands in the larger mesh spaces. Simple linear sorption kinetics gives an adsorption time constant of 5 min and a desorption time constant of about 20 days, suggesting nearly irreversible uptake of cationic avidin on the anionic gel matrix. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

Many novel hydrogel-based delivery matrices have been designed and fabricated to fulfill the ever-increasing needs of the pharmaceutical and medical fields. Mathematical modeling plays an important role in facilitating hydrogel network design by identifying key parameters and molecule release mechanisms. The objective of this article is to review the fundamentals and recent advances in hydrogel network design as well as mathematical modeling approaches related to controlled molecule release from hydrogels. In the first section, the niche roles of hydrogels in controlled release, molecule release mechanisms, and hydrogel design criteria for controlled release applications are discussed. Novel hydrogel systems for drug delivery including biodegradable, smart, and biomimetic hydrogels are reviewed in the second section. Several mechanisms have been elucidated to describe molecule release from polymer hydrogel systems including diffusion, swelling, and chemically-controlled release.

abstract = {Approximately 90{\%} of all ophthalmic drug formulations are now applied as eye drops. While eye drops are convenient and well-accepted by patients, ∼95{\%} of the drug contained in the drops is lost due to absorption through the conjunctiva or through the tear drainage. Ophthalmic drug delivery via contact lenses is more effective because it increases the residence time of the drug in the eye and leads to a larger fractional intake of drug by the cornea. In this paper, we model the drug release from the contact lens into the pre- and postlens tear films and the subsequent uptake by the cornea. The motion of the contact lens, which is driven by the eyelid motion during a blink, enhances the mass transfer in the postlens tear film (POLTF). We use regular perturbation methods to obtain the Taylor dispersion coefficient for mass transfer in the POLTF. The diffusion of drug in the gel is assumed to obey Fick's law, and the diffusion in the gel and the mass transfer in the POLTF are combined to yield an integro-differential equation that is solved numerically by finite difference. Two extreme cases are considered in this paper. The first case corresponds to a rapid breakup of the prelens tear film (PLTF), that prevents drug loss from the anterior lens surface into the PLTF. The second case corresponds to a situation in which the prelens tear film exists at all times and, furthermore, the mixing and the tear drainage in the blink ensure that the concentration in this film is zero at all times. These two cases correspond to the minimum and the maximum loss to the prelens tear film and, thus, represent the highest and the lowest estimations for the fraction of the entrapped drug that diffuses into the cornea. Results show that the dispersion coefficient of the drug in the postlens tear film is unaffected by the release of the drug from the gel. Furthermore, simulation results show that drug delivery from a contact lens is more efficient than drug delivery by drops. The fraction of drug that enters the cornea varies from ∼70 to 95{\%} for the first case (no flux to the PLTF) and from 20 to 35{\%} for the second case (zero concentration in the PLTF). The model predicts that delivery of pilocarpine by soaked contact lenses is ∼35 times more efficient than delivery by drops, and this result matches clinical observations. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {We consider model problems for the tear film over multiple blink cycles that utilize a single equation for the tear film; the single non-linear partial differential equation that governs the film thickness arises from lubrication theory. The two models that we consider arise from considering the absence of naturally occurring surfactant and the case when the surfactant is strongly affecting the surface tension. The film is considered on a time-varying domain length with specified film thickness and volume flux at each end; only one end of the domain is moving, which is analogous to the upper eyelid moving with each blink. Realistic lid motion from observed blinks is included in the model with end fluxes specified to more closely match the blink cycle than those previously reported. Numerical computations show quantitative agreement with in vivo tear film thickness measurements under partial blink conditions. A transition between periodic and non-periodic solutions has been estimated as a function of closure fraction and this may be a criterion for what is effectively a full blink according to fluid dynamics. {\textcopyright} The author 2007.

At pH 2, the hydrogels are nonionic, whereas at pH 7.4, hydrogels are anionic due to MAA ionization. Solute adsorption on and nonspecific electrostatic interaction with the polymer matrix are pronounced. To express deviation from ideal partitioning, we define an enhancement or exclusion factor, E≡k/$\phi$1, where $\phi$1 is hydrogel water volume fraction. All solutes exhibit E{\textgreater}1 in 100wt {\%} HEMA hydrogels owing to strong specific adsorption to HEMA strands. For all solutes, E significantly decreases upon incorporation of anionic MAA into the hydrogel due to lack of adsorption onto charged MAA moieties. For dianionic sodium fluorescein and Oregon Green 488, and partially ionized monoanionic acetazolamide at pH 7.4, however, the decrease in E is more severe than that for similar-sized nonionic solutes.

abstract = {This paper is a first attempt to model mixing in the tear layer of the eye sandwiched between the cornea and a soft contact lens (i.e., the post-lens tear film or POTF). The proposed driving force for mixing is lateral diffusion enhanced by the periodic lateral (up-down) and squeezing (in-out) motion of the contact lens during blinking. In a mechanism similar to Taylor dispersion, the classical diffusion equation emerges at long times when concentration gradients smooth, but with a mechanical dispersion coefficient, D*, rather than a molecular diffusion coefficient, D. Calculated values of the dispersion coefficient are orders of magnitude larger than molecular diffusivities permitting mixing in the POTF on time scales much shorter than that of pure diffusion, L2/D, where L is the lens radius. The dispersive-mixing model is tested against clinical experiments of fluorescein-labeled dextran decay from the POTF on 23 human subjects, each with soft contact lenses of four different diameters. Comparison between theory and experiment for the nonreactive dye is reasonable, especially considering the fact that accurate measurements of several parameters are not available, such as the transverse lens travel and the tear-film thickness. The model captures the essential physics involved in the mixing process but requires modification to improve quantitative prediction. Further, the proposed dispersive-mixing theory for flushing of the POTF serves as a foundation for predicting the mixing behavior of reactive solutes, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and bacteria.},

We have developed a drug-eluting contact lens designed for prolonged delivery of latanoprost for the treatment of glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Latanoprost-eluting contact lenses were created by encapsulating latanoprost-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) films in methafilcon by ultraviolet light polymerization. Invitro and invivo studies showed an early burst of drug release followed by sustained release for one month. Contact lenses containing thicker drug-polymer films demonstrated released a greater amount of drug after the initial burst. Invivo, single contact lenses were able to achieve, for at least one month, latanoprost concentrations in the aqueous humor that were comparable to those achieved with topical latanoprost solution, the current first-line treatment for glaucoma. The lenses appeared safe in cell culture and animal studies. This contact lens design can potentially be used as a treatment for glaucoma and as a platform for other ocular drug delivery applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Purpose: Dry-eye disease, an increasingly prevalent ocular-surface disorder, significantly alters tear physiology. Understanding the basic physics of tear dynamics in healthy and dry eyes benefits both diagnosis and treatment of dry eye. We present a physiological-based model to describe tear dynamics during blinking. Materials and methods: Tears are compartmentalized over the ocular surface; the blink cycle is divided into three repeating phases. Conservation laws quantify the tear volume and tear osmolarity of each compartment during each blink phase. Lacrimal-supply and tear-evaporation rates are varied to reveal the dependence of tear dynamics on dry-eye conditions, specifically tear osmolarity, tear volume, tear-turnover rate (TTR), and osmotic water flow. Results: Predicted periodic-steady tear-meniscus osmolarity is 309 and 321 mOsM in normal and dry eyes, respectively. Tear osmolarity, volume, and TTR all match available clinical measurements. Osmotic water flow through the cornea and conjunctiva contribute 10 and 50{\%} to the total tear supply in healthy and dry-eye conditions, respectively. TTR in aqueous-deficient dry eye (ADDE) is only half that in evaporative dry eye (EDE). Conclusions: The compartmental periodic-steady tear-dynamics model accurately predicts tear behavior in normal and dry eyes. Inclusion of osmotic water flow is crucial to match measured tear osmolarity. Tear-dynamics predictions corroborate the use of TTR as a clinical discriminator between ADDE and EDE. The proposed model is readily extended to predict the dynamics of aqueous solutes such as drugs or fluorescent tags. {\textcopyright} 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

@article{Cerretani2012,
abstract = {In addition to improving oxygen permeability, modern silicone-hydrogel (SiHy) soft contact lenses (SCLs) exceed a limiting diffusive ion permeability to aqueous sodium chloride. Below the ion-permeability threshold, siloxane-based SCLs are prone to bind against the corneal epithelium. Salt permeability is argued to reflect indirectly water hydraulic permeability. However, no quantitative explanation is available to date for a threshold salt permeability. We hypothesize that molecular salt diffusion through a SCL supports the postlens tear film (PoLTF) by enhancing water flow into the PoLTF from the cornea. Higher salt concentrations in the PoLTF raise the osmotic pressure there relative to that in the cornea increasing osmotic water withdrawal from the cornea. The proposed osmotic-withdrawal mechanism successfully predicts a self-consistent threshold lens salt permeability when thin-film attractive binding forces are introduced. For the first time, we present a quantitative picture for the possible origin of a threshold salt permeability in SCL manufacture. {\textcopyright} 2012 British Contact Lens Association.},

@article{Prausnitz1998,
abstract = {The objective of this study was to collect a comprehensive database of ocular tissue permeability measurements found in a review of the literature to guide models for drug transport in the eye. Well over 300 permeability measurements of cornea, sclera, and conjunctiva, as well as corneal epithelium, stroma, and endothelium, were obtained for almost 150 different compounds from more than 40 different studies. In agreement with previous work, the corneal epithelium was shown generally to control transcorneal transport, where corneal stroma and endothelium contribute significantly only to the barrier for small, lipophilic compounds. In addition, other quantitative comparisons between ocular tissues are presented. This study provides an extensive database of ocular tissue permeabilities, which should be useful for future development and validation of models to predict rates of drug delivery to the eye.},
